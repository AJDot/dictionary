# Dictionary

This is a dictionary application made to practice asynchronous requests and working with APIs.
It can be powered by Oxford or Merriam-Webster dictionaries. Change the `API` variable in `dictionary.js` to switch dictionaries.

To run:

- `npm install` or `yarn`
- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
